# Banking Assistant Chatbot with AWS Lex & Lambda! ðŸ¤–

## Overview
Excited to share my latest projectâ€”an AI-powered chatbot using Amazon Lex and AWS Lambda! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ”¹ What It Does
The chatbot interacts with users and retrieves a simulated bank balance using a Lambda function.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features & Capabilities
âœ… **Seamless Lex-Lambda Integration** â€“ The chatbot dynamically invokes a Lambda function to process user requests.  
âœ… **Custom Intents & Code Hooks** â€“ Designed to understand and respond to queries related to account balances with realistic interactions.  
âœ… **Scalable & Serverless** â€“ Leverages AWSâ€™s serverless computing for high availability and performance.  
âœ… **Conversational AI** â€“ Supports natural language processing to enhance user experience.  

## ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used
- **Amazon Lex** â€“ For building the conversational AI chatbot.  
- **AWS Lambda** â€“ To process user queries and return responses.  
- **AWS IAM Roles** â€“ For managing permissions and security.  

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works
1. **User Interaction:** The user types a query (e.g., "Whatâ€™s my account balance?").  
2. **Lex Processing:** Amazon Lex interprets the request using NLP and triggers an intent.  
3. **Lambda Execution:** A pre-configured AWS Lambda function retrieves the simulated bank balance and responds.  
4. **Response:** The chatbot replies with the user's balance details in a conversational manner.  

## ðŸ”¹ Future Enhancements
- Add authentication for secure transactions.
- Expand functionality to support fund transfers and transactions.
- Integrate with external APIs for real-time banking data.

This project demonstrates how AI-powered voice and text chatbots can handle real-world tasks efficiently. From banking inquiries to customer service automation, the possibilities are vast! ðŸš€
